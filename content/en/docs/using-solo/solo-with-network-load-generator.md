## Using Network Load Generator with Solo

The [Network Load Generator (NLG)](https://github.com/hashgraph/network-load-generator) is a benchmarking tool designed to stress test Hiero networks by generating configurable transaction loads.
To use the Network Load Generator with Solo, follow these steps:

1. Create a Solo network:

```bash
npx @hashgraph/solo:@latest one-shot single deploy
```

2. Use the `rapid-fire` commands to install the NLG chart and start a load test:

```bash
@hashgraph/solo:@latest rapid-fire load start --deployment my-deployment --args '"-c 3 -a 10 -t 60"' --test CryptoTransferLoadTest
```

3. In a separate terminal, you can start a different load test:

```bash
@hashgraph/solo:@latest rapid-fire load start --deployment my-deployment --args '"-c 3 -a 10 -t 60"' --test NftTransferLoadTest
```

4. To stop the load test early use the `stop` command:

```bash
@hashgraph/solo:@latest rapid-fire load stop --deployment my-deployment --test CryptoTransferLoadTest
```

5. To stop all running load tests and uninstall the NLG chart, use the `destroy` command:

```bash
@hashgraph/solo:@latest rapid-fire destroy all --deployment my-deployment
```

See this example for more details: [examples/rapid-fire/](../../examples/rapid-fire/)

A full list of all available `rapid-fire` commands can be found in [Solo CLI Commands](solo-commands.md/#rapid-fire)

## Test names and arguments

For a detailed list of all available tests and their arguments, refer to the [Network Load Generator documentation](https://github.com/hashgraph/network-load-generator)
