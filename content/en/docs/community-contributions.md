## How to Contribute to Solo

This document describes how to set up a local development environment and contribute to the Solo project.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (use the version specified in the repository, if applicable)
- **npm**
- **Docker or Podman**
- **Kubernetes** (local cluster such as kind, k3d, or equivalent)
- **task** (Taskfile runner)
- **Git**
- **K9s** (optional)

## Initial setup

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hiero-ledger/solo.git
   cd solo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install solo as a local CLI:

   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

   > **Notes**:
   >
   > - This only needs to be done once.
   > - If `solo` already exists in your `PATH`, remove it first.
   > - Alternatively, run commands via `npm run solo-test -- <COMMAND> <ARGS>`.

4. Run the CLI:

   ```bash
   solo
   ```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 -->

### Logs and debugging

- Solo logs are written to:

  ```bash
  $HOME/.solo/logs/solo.log
  ```

- A common debugging pattern is:

  ```bash
  tail -f $HOME/.solo/logs/solo.log | jq
  ```

## How to Run the Tests

- Unit tests:

  ```bash
  task test
  ```

- List all integration and E2E tasks:

  ```bash
  task --list-all
  ```

## Code formatting

Before committing any changes, always run:

```bash
task format
```

## How to Update Component Versions

- Edit the component's version inside `/version.ts`

## How to Inspect the Cluster

When debugging, it helps to inspect resources and logs in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Kubectl

Common kubectl commands:

- `kubectl get pods -A`
- `kubectl get svc -A`
- `kubectl get ingress -A`
- `kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>`
- `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>`

Official documentation: [kubectl reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)

### K9s (Recommended)

> **K9s** is the primary tool used by the Solo team to inspect and debug Solo deployments.

Why K9s:

- Terminal UI that makes it faster to navigate Kubernetes resources
- Quickly view logs, events, and descriptions
- Simple and intuitive

Start K9s:

```bash
k9s -A
```

Official documentation: [K9s commands](https://k9scli.io/topics/commands/)

## Pull Request Requirements

### DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) and Signed Commits

Two separate requirements are enforced on this repository:

#### 1) DCO Sign-off (required)

Refer to the Hiero Ledger contributing docs under sign-off:
[CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-off](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-off)

Optional: configure Git to always add the sign-off automatically:

```bash
git config --global format.signoff true
```

#### 2) Cryptographically Signed Commits (required)

In addition to the DCO sign-off, the repository also enforces a GitHub rule that blocks commits that are not **signed and verified**.

This means your commits must be cryptographically signed using GPG or SSH and show a **Verified** badge on GitHub.

If your commits are not signed, they will be rejected even if the DCO check passes.

To enable commit signing, see GitHub documentation:

- [GPG signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)
- [SSH signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

After setup, verify signing is enabled:

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Both are required:

- DCO sign-off line (`-s`)
- Cryptographic signature (*Verified commit*)

### Conventional Commit PR titles *(required)*

Pull request titles must follow Conventional Commits.

> Examples:
>
> - `feat: add support for grpc-web fqdn endpoints`
> - `fix: correct version resolution for platform components`
> - `docs: update contributing guide`
> - `chore: bump dependency versions`

This is required for consistent release notes and changelog generation.

### Additional guidelines

- Prefer small, focused PRs that are easy to review.
- If you are unsure where to start, open a draft PR early to get feedback.
- Add description and link all related issues to the PR.
